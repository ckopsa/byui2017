  In the following table, your weighted scores are calculable with an org-mode
  table formula. Put your cursor on the "#+tblfm:" line at the bottom of the
  table and type , , to update these weighted scores after changing any raw
  score. You are welcome to change any scores and play "what if" with your
  grade, but your official scores will need to be merged in when you grant a git
  "pull request" from me or one of my graders.

  The source code block at the bottom of this file will tell you your letter
  grade once you know how to use it. The [[file:grading.org][grading.org]] file has some information
  on how to maximize your grade.

  Note: All raw scores are normalized to 100 total possible.
