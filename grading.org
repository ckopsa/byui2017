My philosophy of grading is simple. Grading is evil. Sadly, it's a necessary
evil, living as we do in a telestial world.

Why do I think grading is evil? Because it presumes to accurately boil down the
performance of a complicated, living, breathing, human being to a NUMBER! And a
very-limited-range number at that. Human beings, children of God, deserve better
treatment than having a one-dimensional label applied to their work.

Still, the grading process does not have to be as painful as it sometimes is.
How painful it is will have a direct effect on the outcome.

So, here's how it works. You start off with perfect performance, 100%, 100
points on everything. You can only go down from there (but sometimes you can go
up)! How do you go down? How do you lose points?

First, when allowed, which is about every other assignment, you are encouraged
to *appropriately* collaborate with your peers, so failure to do so is a major
flaw that is painful for me to see in you, and will cost you. Second, failure to
report what you learned pains me, as it means you missed learning something you
otherwise could have. Things like these make grading hard.

In a nutshell, the /harder/ you make it for me (or my grader) to read and assess
your work, the /lower/ your score. So you can lose points by doing any of the
following (which means you can *avoid* losing points by *NOT* exhibiting these
behaviors):

* Fail to collaborate

  - Fail to identify your collaborators.
  - Fail to identify the contribution of each of your collaborators.

* Fail to engage

  - Fail to learn something new, or make no mention of what you learned.
  - Fail to achieve something meaningful, or something you can build upon at a
    later time.
  - Be bored, unenthusiastic, show no evidence of a curious mind at work.

* Fail to clearly show that you fulfilled a requirement

  - Make no mention of the requirement in your report.
  - Mention it, but fail to describe *how* your work fulfills that requirement.

* Fail to report

  - Fail to write more than a short paragraph.
  - Fail to organize and structure your report with headings, subheadings, etc.
  - Fail to use "plain old text" org-mode for organization and markup.

* Fail to take care

  - Write shoddy sentences, strewn with /mechanical infelicities/
    (e.g., misspelled words, grammatical errors, punctuation errors).
  - Fail to take obvious steps to eliminate these pesky MIs:
    - Spell-check your writing.
    - Grammar-check your writing.
    - Read your writing aloud (or better yet, have someone else read
      it to you) to see how it sounds.
    - Have someone who is good at English carefully proofread your
      writing.

* Questions?

  *Please come see me* if you have any questions/problems/issues to be resolved.
  I abhor, detest, hate, loathe, and rather dislike having discussions about
  your grades *other than in person*.
