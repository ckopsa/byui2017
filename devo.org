** What are different things that would be good to work on?
*** To-Do Lists
    - Make them during nightly planning before I go to bed.
    - When should I go to bed?
*** Scripture Study
    - Wake up early, because I am going to bed on time. After I wake up and
      pray, study scriptures.
    - When will I wake up?
*** Family History
    - Luckily this is my calling now, so doing this can be a 2-bird 1-stone
      process.
    - How am I going to make Family History such a big deal that people won't
      know how to deal with it?
*** Journal
    - Is it realistic to try and keep a journal?
      - Having a brother on a mission makes this fairly easy for a weekly
        journal.
      - Should I do any more than this?
      - What will I do when Carson comes home?
*** Church Preparation
    - Study for Elders Quorum
    - Study for Sunday School?
    - Prepare for Family History Class.
      - How am I going to make Family History fun/cool/unstoppable?
        - I think the mistake is to turn it into something that it isn't
          - Initially, I think it would be a good idea to turn it into some sort
            of competitive game, but that wouldn't be what the Lord would want.
            He'd like to have people excited about Family History because they
            want to learn more about their ancestors and gain joy from helping
            them progress spiritually.
        - So what are the root ideas of Family History?
          - The Spirit of Elijah
            - Turning the hearts of the children towards their fathers
              - Gaining love for ancestors, and seeking to learn more about
                them. 
              - This love should then lead to a desire to perform
                ordinances in God's temple for your loved ancestors.
            - Turning the hearts of the fathers towards their children
              - Journaling
          - Temple Work
** What are some things that were inspired for me from devotional?
   - How can I remember the sacrifices that were made to bring me the word of
     God?
     - Would it be possible, as a reminder to study scriptures, every day that I
       went without studying the scriptures that I would then need to memorize
       an account where someone sacrificed for the Gospel.

** How are things going this week?
   Well, I am not sure I feel one problem that I have is that I don't like
   reading... However, learning that read comes from the same root where we
   derive the word "riddle", I think it is a bit more interesting. I feel,
   however, that I can't read unless I have a good purpose behind it, both
   academically and spiritually.

   I think I just find it difficult to focus on content when I don't have the
   mental stamina to question what is being said. I find that's the problem when I
   am reading articles for class, when I am listening to devotional, or when I am
   trying to solve a problem.

** What if I made studying by reading my greatest strength?
   What would it take to be a proficient student by reading?
