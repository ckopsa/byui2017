What are some of the most popular IDEs or editors for web development
today?  

Free & Open Source: Atom 

Atom is a simple, yet extensible text editor built by GitHub for web
development. It has a built in package manager that allows one to
quickly add/remove features to improve productivity. It works
cross-platform, so anyone using a Windows, Mac, or Linux machine can
use it. It provides auto-completion, file system browsing, and find
and replace over an entire project.

Proprietary: WebStorm

WebStorm is a lot heavier of an applicaiton, but provides a more
polished product. It has all the features stated about Atom, but adds
code inspection with quick-fixes, coding assistance with popular
frameworks, and debugging features.
